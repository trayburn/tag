Had to install mysql ...

start mysql via 'sudo systemctl start mysql'

to start on a reboot: `sudo systemctl enable mysql`

After installing, reset the root password for mysql via https://devanswers.co/how-to-reset-mysql-root-password-ubuntu/
I set it to "password"

Set our user (dr_j) with a password (supertopsecretpassw0rd) via
https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/mysql/managing-mysql-databases-and-users-from-the-command-line
#########################

Had to modify pom, adding source and target levels (so not just release):

    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.release>11</maven.compiler.release>
        <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>

Otherwise, the openjdk from amazon wouldn't work (or maybe it's my version of maven?)

#########################

Modified the TagWorldCreate.sql, adding "IF EXISTS" to delete tables initially.
Otherwise, rerunning the the entire script wouldn't work (would fail if the tables didn't exist)

#########################

SpringContext.java --- had to add my username and password.

#########################

Added some entries to .gitignore so I don't commit Eclipse files.

#########################

And, after some stumbling, having Eclipse not able to push or pull, I realized I had to add github.com to my ~/.ssh/config file. 8^)
